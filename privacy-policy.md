# Privacy Policy for Open in ChatGPT Extension

Last Updated: March 3, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the "Open in ChatGPT" browser extension handles user information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our practices.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We Do Not Collect Any Data.**

The "Open in ChatGPT" extension:
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not store or transmit your browsing history
- Does not track your online activity
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools
- Does not create user profiles
- Does not sell or share any information with third parties

## How the Extension Works

1. **Text Selection**: When you select text on a webpage and use our context menu option, the extension only processes the text you explicitly select.
2. **Data Transmission**: The selected text is only sent directly to the official ChatGPT website (https://chat.openai.com or https://chatgpt.com).
3. **No Intermediaries**: The text travels directly from your browser to ChatGPT's serversâ€”our extension does not intercept, store, or process this information.

## Permissions

Our extension requires certain permissions to function properly:
- **contextMenus**: To add the right-click menu option
- **tabs**: To interact with and open ChatGPT tabs
- **scripting**: To insert your selected text into ChatGPT
- **Host permissions** for ChatGPT domains: To interact only with the official ChatGPT website

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of the extension and not for data collection purposes.

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service this extension interacts with is ChatGPT (operated by OpenAI). When you use our extension to send text to ChatGPT, that text becomes subject to [OpenAI's privacy policy](https://openai.com/privacy/).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
